This code uses the collocation spectral method to solve the ordinary
differential equation

    f'(x) = 2x

over the domain [-1, 1], with the initial condition

    f(0) = 0.

The solution is

    f(x) = x^2.

The software required to compile and run this code consist of the following:

  - a C compiler
  - CMake
  - the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) library


If you have those, perform the following, from the top level of the code
directory.

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

The binary will be placed in build/src/test_spectral_rt. To run it, type

  ./src/test_spectral_rt



The output is contained in a file called "results.dat". It contains 3 columns:

        [ordinate grid] [exact solution] [numerical solution]
