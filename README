This code uses the Galerkin spectral method to solve the ordinary differential
equation

    f'(x) = 2x

over the domain [0, 1], with the initial condition

    f(0) = 0.

The solution is

    f(x) = x^2.

To compile this code, you need a C compiler and the CMake package. You also
need to have the GNU Scientific Library (gsl) installed, along with  BLAS 
and LAPACK. If you have those, perform the following, from the top level of 
the code directory.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

The binary will be placed in build/src/test_galerkin_method. To run it, type

./src/test_galerkin_method



The output is contained in 3 files:

    - solutions.dat: contains the exact and numerical solutions of the ODE.

    - basis_functions.dat: contains in separate columns the quantity c_n *
      T_n(x), where T_n(x) is the nth Chebyshev polynomial of the 1st kind (the
      basis functions chosen to solve this problem), and c_n is the
      corresponding coefficient which the Galerkin method calculates. The sum
      of all of these columns at each ordinate yields the numerical solution to
      the ODE.

    - coefficients.dat: contains a list of the calculated coefficients c_n.
