This code uses the Galerkin spectral method to solve the ordinary differential
equation

    f'(x) = 2x

over the domain [0, 1], with the initial condition

    f(0) = 0.

The solution is

    f(x) = x^2.

To compile this code, you need a C compiler and the CMake package. If you have
those, perform the following, from the top level of the code directory.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

The binary will be placed in build/src/test_galerkin_method. To run it, type

./src/test_galerkin_method

The output contains 3 columns: the domain points, the exact solution, and the
numerical solution.
