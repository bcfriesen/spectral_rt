This code uses the Galerkin spectral method to solve the ordinary differential
equation

    f'(x) = 2x

over the domain [0, 1], with the initial condition

    f(0) = 0.

The solution is

    f(x) = x^2.

The basis functions are the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.

The spectral coefficients are saved in the grid function
"spectral_method::spec_coeff".
